# CS-230-Entreprenuerism-Ethics-Project
Our product is a website tool that lets kids save passwords and show them the safety of the internet. 
With lectures given almost like Duolingo where we ask kids what to do in certain situations. 
When saving passwords the website can give tips on how to create unique and stronger passwords.
With a little help me button in the bottom right ready to help kids with any questions about the internet or passwords. 
With professionals helping guide them to prevent random users from interacting with kids in unwanted ways. 
A service that we hope should be taught across schools as an extra essential class as we continue using the internet from day to day lives
